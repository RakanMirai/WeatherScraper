# üéâ Major Update: OpenWeatherMap Integration

## ‚úÖ What's Been Added

### 1. **OpenWeatherMap API Integration**
   - **Fallback system**: If wttr.in fails, automatically switches to OpenWeatherMap
   - **Real historical data**: Fetch past 7 days of actual weather (no more relying on user searches!)
   - **Source tracking**: App now shows which data source is being used

### 2. **Environment Configuration**
   - **`.env.example`**: Template for your API key
   - **`.env`**: You need to create this manually (see steps below)
   - **python-dotenv**: Added to requirements.txt for loading environment variables

### 3. **Updated Files**

#### `weather_scraper.py`
   - Added `_get_weather_from_owm()`: OpenWeatherMap fallback for current weather
   - Added `get_historical_weather()`: Fetch real historical data from API
   - Smart fallback: tries wttr.in first, falls back to OpenWeatherMap if needed
   - Added `source` field to weather data to track which API was used

#### `app.py`
   - **Removed**: User search-based historical tracking (no more saving weather on every search)
   - **Added**: Real historical weather display using OpenWeatherMap API
   - Shows data source badge in sidebar when using fallback
   - Displays helpful messages if API key is missing
   - Historical section now fetches actual past weather, not user search logs

#### `requirements.txt`
   - Added `python-dotenv==1.0.0`

#### Documentation
   - **SETUP.md**: Complete guide for getting API key
   - **README.md**: Updated with new features and API info
   - **CHANGES.md**: This file!

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Step 1: Install New Dependency
```bash
pip install python-dotenv==1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Create Your .env File

**Option A - Manually create it:**
1. Create a file named `.env` in the project root
2. Add this line:
```
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Option B - Copy from example:**
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```
Then edit `.env` and replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual key.

### Step 3: Get Your API Key (Optional)
1. Go to https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Sign up (free!)
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. Paste it in your `.env` file

**Note**: The app works WITHOUT an API key! You'll just see a message in the historical section.

### Step 4: Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üéØ What Works With/Without API Key

### ‚úÖ Without API Key (100% Free)
- Current weather (from wttr.in) ‚úÖ
- Tomorrow's forecast (from wttr.in) ‚úÖ
- Smart city autocomplete ‚úÖ
- Beautiful UI and charts ‚úÖ
- Search history ‚úÖ

### ‚≠ê With Free API Key
- All of the above ‚úÖ
- Automatic fallback if wttr.in is down ‚úÖ
- Historical weather section (limited - see note) ‚ö†Ô∏è

### üî• With Paid API Key ($40+/month)
- Everything above ‚úÖ
- Full 7-day historical weather data ‚úÖ

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Historical Data Limitation**: OpenWeatherMap's free tier doesn't provide true historical weather data. The paid "One Call API 3.0" subscription is needed for full historical access.

2. **The App Still Works Great Without It**: You get current weather and forecasts perfectly without any API key!

3. **Fallback is Automatic**: If wttr.in ever goes down, having an API key means the app keeps working.

4. **Your API Key is Safe**: The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` and won't be committed to git.

## üé® User Experience Changes

### Before
- Historical section showed your search history (same temps if searched multiple times per day)
- Confusing "This Week's Weather History" that was really just when you searched

### After  
- Historical section shows ACTUAL past weather from OpenWeatherMap
- Clear message if API key not configured
- Source badge shows which API is being used
- Much cleaner and more accurate!

## üîÑ Migration Notes

- **Old search-based history**: No longer saved (cleaner, faster)
- **Search history**: Still works! (Shows past city searches for quick access)
- **No data loss**: Search history is preserved, weather history wasn't useful anyway

## üêõ Testing

Test the app in these scenarios:

1. **Without .env file**: Should work, show message in historical section
2. **With invalid API key**: Should work with wttr.in, show error for historical
3. **With valid API key**: Everything works + historical data (if paid tier)

## üí° Tips

- Get the free API key anyway - it's good for fallback!
- Free tier gives you 60 calls/minute, plenty for personal use
- The app is designed to work great even without OpenWeatherMap
